JackpotCoin (JACKPOT) 

JackpotCoin is a PoW/PoS coin that is designed to be the unit of cybercoin.

Hybrid Dual Block Chain 

   PoW and PoS block chains are oganized within a block chain but managed independantly. 
   It makes more stable operation of hybid blocks without some Diff control or 
   Unreasonable block time. 
   
   Two semi-independant block chains are support two major advantages. 
   
   Stable large coin distribution with PoW Chain
   Stable Fast coin transaction with PoS Chain

   Most of TxFee and Interest will be paid to PoS miner, it is a fair way for the network
   maintainers.
   


AdvSHA3

   We are using the customized and optimized very secure hashing method for this coin, 
   It is base on SHA3 and Its candidates (BLAKE, JH, GROESTL, SKEIN). 

   1 round SHA3 (Keccak) input hashing with 
   9 rounds random using 4  candidates hashing methods are applied,
   
   It is the most secure hashing method, using ALU and Internal Memory of GPU to reduce
   the power consumption. and CPU frendly method. 
  
   for The ASIC, the cost of ASIC is ~10x more than the general scrypt ASIC due to 
   the complicity of code and RAM/CACHE requirments, it's hard to apply on ASIC quickly.
   We are estimating it will takes ~5 years to appy on ASIC with the reasonable cost.
   It means, this method has ~5 years ASIC resist, 
   
   It is the fair way to support CPU/GPU miner at beginning, and 
   the fair way to support ASIC at the network maintenance stage.
   

   
Super Block Reward with Anti-Cheating

   To avoid the cheating miner, true random reward system has applied. 
   In this system, the super block rewards are distributed to the super block hash generator
   instead of finder. so, cheating miner can not archive the selective mining 
   to hurt the super block only.
   
   The rewards are depend on the period from the previous super block, 
   If no one find the super block over long time, the rewards will be increasing,
   
   (1) constant reward over time
   (2) various reward depend on the luck
   
   Note : the status of superblock reward (such as possible rewards) will be couting on 
          website in realtime,
